# Javascript introduction
## features of js
## variables and constants - let and const
## data types in js
## operators- arithmetic, assignment

## if, if-else, multiple if-else, nested-if
Ex: 1 -> Monday
2 -> tuesday
3
4
5
6
7 -Sunday
else
-> wrong input




nested-if
if(condition){
	if(condition){
		//code
	}
	else if(){

	}
	else if()
}
else{
	//code
}


## logical operator with if-else
logical operators
-- ||   or operator   if any of the condition is true, code will execute
if(condition1 || condition2 || condition3...||condition n){
	//code if any condition is true
}
else {
	//code  if all if conditons false
}

-- &&   and operator
if(condition1 && condition2 && condition3...&&condition n){
	//code if all conditions are true
}
else {
	//code  if any of conditons false
}

!  not operator
if(!x){
	//condition is false
}
else{
	//code
}

if(!a>5){

}

Ex: enter  month  string input   jan, feb, march,april...

no. of days

Ex: input a number
if number is divisible by 3 - print milk
if number is divisible by 5 - print pop
if number is divisble by 3 as well as 5 - print popmilk

## loops- for, while

loop- doing repetitive task
for loop

for(initilization;testing condition;updation){
	//code that needs to be repeated
}

ex: print even and odd numbers from 1 to 50
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even....
