	<p>Pretty rug. We got this for our entry but have since moved it to the study due to it not being a high traffic area. The rug is showing wear sooner than Iâ€™d like.</p>
	<p id="p2">Color is very good! Just like it looked in the picture.</p>
	<p id="p2">It was exactly what I was looking for. The colors matched perfectly and the rug is extremely soft. I was lucky enough to get it at a very good price.</p>
