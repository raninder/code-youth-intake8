//For loop

/*
1)
Create a variable called myNumber, set it to a number between 0 and 10
Create a for loop that runs from 0 to 10, if i equals your number, console.log("My number is " + i)
*/

/*
2)
Create a for loop that runs 3 times,
Before the loop starts, console.log("Loop Start")
if the loop is on it's first iteration, console.log("First Iteration")
if the loop is on it's second iteration, console.log("Second Iteration")
if the loop is on it's third iteration, console.log("Third Iteration")
when the for loop ends, console.log("Loop End")
*/

/*
3)
    Create a variable called year, set it to 1970
    Using a for loop check if each year from 1970 to 2022 is a leap year
